The file "File" is the input source of the program. It is from this file that the results that need to be translated appear. It is important to put it at the source of the project (or to modify the access path to it (present from the first lines of the program).

If there are errors in the file format, a "FileLog" file is created in which the errors are presented in a simplified manner.
